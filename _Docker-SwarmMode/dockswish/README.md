# docker-swarm-scripts

## Purpose

Create and manage services in a docker swarm easily

## Description

This repository contains small scripts which can help you create and manage your docker services in a docker swarm environment.

I used these scripts to fill the gaps that I saw in docker CLI just for myself. They helped me managing my docker swarms on multiple hosts. 

### Usage

I hope script names are descriptive enough, but some scripts has comment lines inside which describes purpose and usage. So you should consider having a look at the contents of the scripts before using them.

Please feel free to customize or improve them and if you wish send me a merge reuqest.

Hope they also help you :)
