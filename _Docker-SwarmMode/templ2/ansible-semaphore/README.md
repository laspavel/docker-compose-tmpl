# Ansible Semaphore

Ansible Semaphore is a web-based GUI for managing and controlling Ansible tasks, playbooks, and roles. It allows you to easily track and manage Ansible jobs across different environments, monitor the status of tasks, and view logs in real-time. With Ansible Semaphore, you can also set up access controls and assign different levels of permissions to different users. This can be useful for managing access to sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users can run specific tasks. Overall, Ansible Semaphore can help streamline your Ansible workflows and make it easier to manage your infrastructure as code.
